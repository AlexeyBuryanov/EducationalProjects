# PluginsAssembly
## Task
Develop an application for working with plugins. A plugin is a .NET assembly with a dll extension, located in the Plugins folder of our application. The program scans the Plugins folder and lists the names of all available plugins from the folder. The user selects a plugin and the program loads it (finds the desired class and the desired method in the assembly). All plugins allow you to somehow change the appearance of the application window and controls in the window.
